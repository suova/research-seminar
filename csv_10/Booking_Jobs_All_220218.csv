This role will work heavily with online data and live decisioning of product offerings on Booking’s website. 
Machine Learning Scientists are technical innovators and implementers. They own the complete lifecycle of production-ready machine learning models. The machine learning model lifecycle consists of hypothesis generation, data creation/collection, training, testing, evaluating, tuning, generalising, debugging and monitoring. 
MLS estimates the effort and impact of the items they work on and have a high quality of craft in what they deliver. To create production-ready machine learning models MLSs are expected to work together with peers and counterparts in other job roles (e.g. Developers, Designers, Product Owners, etc.).
You will thrive at Booking.com if you are result-focused, innovative, and with a solid quantitative background, but most of all by understanding our complex business model and the logic behind it.
B.RESPONSIBLE
Working with company data, this position will lead the development of ML products that determine the best payments or fintech product to offer our customers in a live/online environment on our websites. This will involve data mining with batch data, determining the right model/algorithm for the job, and working with engineers to implement the model in a live environment. This will also require designing processes to continually monitor and improve the model. 
The Senior Machine Learning Scientist is a deep subject-matter expert in the theory behind one or more areas of machine intelligence (e.g. recommenders, optimization, NLP, Computer Vision) and its implementation as an end-to-end product that generates direct business impact. They define the strategy and vision for how to generate outsized impact through automated intelligence in a broad product area by driving a research agenda and development plan from ideation to prototyping to full productionisation.
Key Responsibilities:
Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment. 
Develop the strategy for machine intelligence on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences. 
Independently define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders. 
Drive the end-to-end execution of the ML/AI development process on products, from understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch- and stream-based deployment. 
Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining. 
Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs. 
Create outsized impact for your work through carefully designed rapid prototyping coupled with strategic scale-up in production through the work of other teams. 
Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
