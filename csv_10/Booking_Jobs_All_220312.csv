But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners and people, we can empower everyone to experience the world.
We’re a truly global e-commerce company, with business operations in nearly every country and city on the planet. And we want to make it easy for everyone, anywhere in the world, to pay for their travel or do business with our platform – whenever and however it’s convenient for them.
Our brand new FinTech business unit – with teams in Amsterdam and Shanghai – develops new products and drives innovation to help us continue removing financial friction from the travel  process. That makes buying and selling travel-related products and services simpler for both travellers and partners.
The RegTech department’s mission is to deliver the most effective and yet user-friendly tools to help the company in regulatory needs: compliance, anti-fraud, anti-financial crime initiatives that require us to check more thoroughly how we are conducting our business. To comply with the many new regulations meant to protect companies and people, we need to introduce some extra checks here and there, which can easily become a burden to our customers and partners. Our job is to make that experience as smooth as possible, as frictionless as possible, and yet to comply with all the relevant regulations.
Within the RegTech family, the Group Product Manager will be leading a team focused in creating and improving the tools that our customers and partners will use to provide us with the information that we need. That includes mechanisms to retrieve information, to verify information, to monitor transactions, and also to integrate areas of the business that need to be aware of each other.

As the leader of your product team, you are further responsible for the product roadmap of the area. This roadmap will include the continued development of tools such as identification mechanisms (how to identify our guests and partners?); verification mechanisms (how to make sure we know who we are dealing with?); and all sorts of measures to guarantee the safety of our guests, partners, and company;
Together with your Product Managers you translate the vision and mission into product roadmaps and goals for the individual teams. You support them with planning, prioritizing and delivering on those plans;
You use both quantitative and qualitative research to improve the product;
You will report directly to the Director of Product RegTech;
You will contribute to the growth of Booking.com through interviewing, onboarding, or other recruitment efforts.
What you’ll bring:
Be the voice of the customer and the driving force behind product innovation from in-depth product understanding and feature development through to experimentation;
You are a smart, hands-on and creative product leader with 5 - 7+ years of experience in Product management in FinTech companies or the financial department of a global online marketplace. You have a technical background and a deep affinity with Technology and software development; 
You have at least 7 years experience working with building Payments and/or financial transactions products, ideally for an online global marketplace;
You have at least 4 years hands-on experience with developing customer facing products,  ideally for an online global marketplace;
You’re a Customer-focused individual who keeps the customer at the heart of everything you do, while having strong commercial awareness;
You are passionate about product development and constantly looking for ways to improve it;
You have a Demonstrable experience in shaping and leading multiple product teams across multiple products or business areas (+3 years as a manager);
You have a Track record shaping products from concept through delivery at scale;
You are a Natural leader and communicator who is collaborative and builds great relationships;
You have a knack for connecting the dots and collaborating with various stakeholders to prioritize what maximizes business value;

You have experience with working with a large variety of internal stakeholders, including marketing, legal, compliance, finance and other product areas;
You are experienced with experimentation using, for example, A/B-testing focused on improving conversion and retention.
